- 👋 Hi, I’m Seoeun Shin who is working in Center for Quantum Dynamics as a researcher
- 👀 I’m interested in solid-state lithium battery system, computer programming (python, MATLAB, ...), and eco-friendly electronics development
- 🌱 I majored in physical chemistry (IR, Raman spectroscopy) and I'm currently learning python and MATLAB to improve programming skills
- 💞️ I’m looking for interesting works that research solid-state lithium battery system with IR, Raman spectroscopy and computational chemistry or optimize internal systems of electronics
- 📫 If you want to contact me, here is my e-mail address : fluidam23@hanmail.net
